## Overview

A `ldict` is a `dict` with `str` keys.

<<simple>>

We consider that every value is generated by a process, starting from an `empty` ldict. The process is a sequence of
transformation steps done through the operator `>>`, which symbolizes a data flow. There are two types of steps:

* **value insertion** - represented by dict-like objects
* **function application** - represented by ordinary python functions

A `ldict` is completely defined by its key-value pairs so that
it can be converted from/to a built-in dict.

Creating a ldict is not different from creating an ordinary dict. Optionally it can be created through the `>>` operator
used after `empty`:

Function application is done in the same way. The parameter names define the input fields, while the keys in the
returned dict define the output fields:

Similarly, for anonymous functions:

Finally, the result is only evaluated at request:

## Installation
### ...as a standalone lib
```bash
# Set up a virtualenv. 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install from PyPI...
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -U ldict
pip install -U ldict[full]  # use this for extra functionality (recommended)

# ...or, install from updated source code.
pip install git+https://github.com/davips/ldict
```

### ...from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davips/ldict
cd ldict
poetry install
```

<!--- ## Persistence
Extra dependencies can be installed to support saving data to disk or to a server in the network. 

**[still an ongoing work...]**

`poetry install -E full`

## Concept

A ldict is like a common Python dict, with extra functionality and lazy. It is a mapping between string keys, called
fields, and any serializable (pickable protocol=5) object.
